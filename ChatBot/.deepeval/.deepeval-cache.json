{"test_cases_lookup_map": {"{\"actual_output\": \"### The Mysterious Black Hole\\n\\nA **black hole** is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, including light, can escape. It's formed when a massive star collapses in on itself and its gravity becomes so strong that it warps the fabric of spacetime around it.\\n\\n#### Characteristics of Black Holes\\n\\n* **Event Horizon**: The point of no return around a black hole. Once you cross the event horizon, you're trapped.\\n* **Singularity**: The center of a black hole where the density and curvature are infinite.\\n* **Mass**: Black holes can have masses ranging from a few solar masses to supermassive ones found at the centers of galaxies.\\n\\n#### How Black Holes Form\\n\\n1. A massive star runs out of fuel and dies.\\n2. The star collapses under its own gravity, causing a massive explosion known as a supernova.\\n3. If the star is massive enough, its core collapses into a singularity, forming a black hole.\\n\\n#### Effects on Light and Matter\\n\\n* **Gravitational Lensing**: The bending of light around a black hole due to its strong gravity.\\n* **Frame-Dragging**: The rotation of spacetime around a rotating black hole.\\n* **Hawking Radiation**: A theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation due to quantum effects.\\n\\n#### Detection and Study\\n\\n* **X-rays and Gamma Rays**: Telescopes can detect X-ray and gamma-ray emissions from hot gas swirling around black holes.\\n* **Gravitational Waves**: The detection of gravitational waves by LIGO and VIRGO have confirmed the existence of black holes.\\n* **Astrometry**: By measuring the motion of stars near a suspected black hole, astronomers can infer its presence.\\n\\n#### Mysteries Remain\\n\\nDespite our growing understanding of black holes, many questions still remain:\\n\\n* What's inside a black hole?\\n* How do black holes affect the surrounding environment?\\n* Can we harness the power of black holes?\\n\\nThe study of black holes continues to fascinate and intrigue us, revealing new secrets about the universe and its most mysterious phenomena.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": \"\\nRespond in Markdown.
